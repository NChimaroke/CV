      <p><em>Aerospace Engineer<br>Founder and CEO of <strong><a href="https://www.dodate.us">Dodate</a></strong><br>Upcoming <strong>Web & Mobile</strong> Developer<br>Silver Spring, MD 20906</em></p>
      <p>I am a driven and versatile aerospace engineer dedicated to the advancement of human space exploration. Through my past projects and positions, I have exhibited great ability and experience in the
      analysis and design of expendable and reusable space launch, space, and reentry vehicles In each of my roles, I aim to demonstrate strong research, analytical, and communication skills used to lead
      teams and work in collaborative as well as independent environments.</p>

      <p>I discovered my passion for software development after several 'turndowns' while seeking pre-seed investment for my first company
      Dodate, so I decided to learn coding and build it myself. I must state that it was indeed the best decision, and I love my new passion so much because it has widespread applications even in my
      beloved field of aerospace engineering.</p></td>

        <td><p>In this role, I executed the construction of a of a low-mass, low-cost Minimum Ascent Vehicle (MAV) to deliver a two-person crew from the Martian surface to low Mars orbit. Working in a
          team, I oversaw the design and development of the crew life support systems, crew safety measures, and backup plans.

              <li><p>I championed the creation of an MAV concept with dry mass less than 5,000 kg, ISRU propellant production on Martian surface, and development estimate less than the $2 billion annual
                spending proposed by NASA.</p></li>
                <li><p>I devised a sample stowage method to avoid crew compartment contamination via an external hatch before ingressing the MAV, and retrieval through an internal hatch while egressing
                  the MAV.</p></li>

          longitudinal, latitudinal, and altitude data was able to be stored. With this data I constructed a GroundTracks unit using Arduino Uno and servo motors to convert longitudinal, latitudinal,
          and elevation data to reference the ISS's coordinates and points the tracker in the direction of the ISS's azimuth, elevation, and range.</td>
